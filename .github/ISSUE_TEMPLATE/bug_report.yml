        Create a minimal reproduction of the problem. **A minimal reproduction is required** so that others can help debug your issue. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it may be closed.

        Be sure to share the repo on GitHub. GitHub's repo is ready to debug using Codespace.  
        Please DON'T USE non-GitHub repos such as GitLab as repro.  
        It takes me a long time to prepare my local PC for debugging.  
        Please DON'T USE StackBlitz as a repro.  
        We can't debug eslint with StackBlitz.
